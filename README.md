Sadie - A reactive component library [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/IceDragon200/Sadie.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/IceDragon200/Sadie)
====================================

## Introduction
Sadie, or what I prefer to call it, Sadie's Reaktors, is a library of Electrical inspired Objects, which 'connect' together to perform different operations (well currently it just passes an energy parameter around)

## Current Reaktors
```
Callback
Capacitor
Counter
Drain
Emitter
Floodgate
Fuse
Multiplex
Relay

SevenSegment
  Useless without some form of visual feedback

TwoWaySwitch
  Works just like a real 2 Way Switch, the switch must be #toggle externally for it to function unlike a Relay.
```

## require
[RGSS3-MACL](https://github.com/IceDragon200/RGSS3-MACL)
```
  Specifically
    MACL::Mixin::Callback
```
